# Landing page visual kits

Canvora has a section-aware mode that nothing else in the toolchain does: give
it a URL and it reads the page's actual sections, decides which ones deserve a
visual, and renders a matching kit. One command, a whole page's imagery, in the
page's own language.

Requires the **Starter plan or higher** — a 403 here means the plan, not auth.
Setup and credits: see the `canvora` skill.

## The one command

```bash
ID=$(canvora generate --url https://example.com --landing-page \
  --brand $BRAND --logo | head -1)
canvora status "$ID" --json    # repeat every ~30s until completed
```

`--format` is not required in this mode: the kit is derived from the page.
`--landing-page` requires `--url` (it has nothing to read otherwise).

A kit is up to 10 visuals, so fire-and-poll rather than `--wait` — most
harnesses kill a shell command at 120s while the kit carries on rendering
server-side. Never re-run `generate` after a timeout; poll `status`
(detail in the `canvora` skill's "Long runs" section). Say the cost in the same
message as the run: 10 credits per visual, so a full kit is up to 100. Announce
it, don't ask permission — but if the page could yield the full 10 and they
only wanted a hero, settle that first.

## What it produces, and what it deliberately skips

The pipeline maps sections onto these formats:

| Format | Section |
|---|---|
| `landingPage-Hero` | 21:9 hero banner |
| `landingPage-Feature` | feature blocks |
| `landingPage-Process` | how-it-works |
| `landingPage-Showcase` | product showcase |
| `landingPage-Stats` | metrics / proof |
| `landingPage-Testimonial` | quotes |
| `landingPage-Comparison` | vs / before-after |
| `landingPage-Timeline` | roadmap / history |
| `landingPage-CTA` | closing call to action |
| `landingPage-UseCase` | **never auto-emitted** — name it explicitly to get it |

Caps and guarantees, so you can set expectations before spending credits:

- at most **10 sections** and **10 visuals** per run; at most **5 per section**
- **hero and CTA are never trimmed** — everything else competes for slots
- FAQ, team, contact, footer and logo walls are intentionally skipped: they are
  not visual sections. If the user wants one anyway, generate it as a normal
  format in a separate call.

Note the IDs are camelCase with a hyphen — `landingPage-Hero`, not
`landing_page_hero`. Guessing the snake_case version fails.

## Intake

Usually just: **the URL** and **the brand kit**. Then two judgement calls:

1. **Is the page live and public?** The page has to be publicly fetchable —
   staging behind auth, localhost, and password walls won't work. Ask for the
   public URL.
2. **Whole page or one section?** If they only want a hero, don't use this mode
   — run `--format landingPage-Hero` with `--url` normally and spend 10 credits
   instead of a kit's worth.

Language is taken from the site itself, so a Spanish page yields Spanish
visuals without you passing anything.

## Selective runs (when the kit is overkill)

```bash
# Just the hero
canvora generate --url $URL --format landingPage-Hero --brand $BRAND --wait --json

# Hero + CTA + the use-case visual the kit never emits on its own (3 outputs — poll)
ID=$(canvora generate --url $URL \
  --format landingPage-Hero,landingPage-CTA,landingPage-UseCase \
  --brand $BRAND | head -1)
canvora status "$ID" --json

```

## After generation

- Hand back **URL per section**, not a flat list — the user has to place these.
  Sort by `sortOrder` and label each with its format ID.
- A section that looks wrong is an `edit` (3 credits), not a re-run of the kit.
- Rebranding later? `canvora variations <id>` or re-run with a different
  `--brand`; the page reading is the expensive part, not the rendering.

## Quality checklist

- [ ] Public, live URL confirmed
- [ ] `--landing-page` used only for a whole kit; single sections run as normal formats
- [ ] Brand kit applied
- [ ] Outputs labelled by section, not dumped as a list
- [ ] Plan gate explained if a 403 comes back
